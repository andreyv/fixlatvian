README for the FixLatvian package
=================================

Introduction
---------------------------------
The FixLatvian package is an attempt to improve Latvian language support in
LaTeX, most prominently in standard document classes. It extends the
functionality of the polyglossia package and as such requires XeTeX to work.
The new features are implemented either directly or through use of other
packages. Notable improvements are listed below:
  * Latvian ordinal number format in headings, contents and labels;
  * Latvian word order in part, chapter, float, theorem and other headings;
  * additional translations, alphabetic numbering using the Latvian alphabet;
  * per-page footnote numbers;
  * comma decimal separator;
  * support for a few other LaTeX packages.

See the documentation (in Latvian) for detailed description and the source
code. See http://code.google.com/p/fixlatvian/ for new releases, future plans
and bug reports.

Installation
---------------------------------
In simple cases placing the fixlatvian.sty file in the directory with the
document top-level .tex file is sufficient. The package can then be loaded with
the \usepackage{fixlatvian} command. Alternatively the package files can be
copied to a local texmf tree.
